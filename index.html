Hi there! I am Afzal Ahmad. I recently graduated from IIT Guwahati, India with a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. I am currently working as a research assistant at the <a href="http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/">Multi-Robot Systems</a> lab, CTU, Prague. 
<br/>
<br/>
I love working with robots. My interest lies in multi-robot intelligence and coordination and to bring this technology to real life. I have worked on swarm robotics at <a href="http://mistlab.ca/">MIST</a> lab, Polytechnique Montreal. I also worked with Prof. Indrani Kar on developing a multi-robot planning and coordination method. You can visit the <a href="https://afzalhmd14.github.io/menu/projects.html">projects</a> page for more details.
<br/>
<br/>

I love to discuss about new ideas and technologies. Especially in the field of Robotics and A.I. If you want to get in touch, just drop me an email.
