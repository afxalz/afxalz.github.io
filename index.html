Hi there! I am Afzal Ahmad. I am an undergraduate student in Electronics and Electrical Engg. department at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India. 
<br/>
I love working with robots. My interests lie in programming intelligence into what might seem to be just a machine. I have worked on Swarm Robotics at <a href="http://mistlab.ca/">MIST</a>  lab, Polytechnique Montreal, Canada. 
<br/>
<br/>
I love to discuss about new ideas and technologies. Especially in the field of Robotics and A.I. If you want to get in touch, just drop me an email.
