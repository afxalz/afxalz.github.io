**Autonomous Robot for Library Enhancement**
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This project is a part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdKhtsYo7OM"><b>4i Lab</b></a> initiative of Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati to enable students to create novel solutions for real-world problems using state-of-the-art technology. My team completed the first version of the robot capable of book identification and autonomous navigation inside the institute library. It is designed to help the library staff as well as the readers in efficient and immediate management of the library.  
<br/>
My focus was on creating a path planning algorithm and integrating the ROS-based control pipeline. We used a 2d LIDAR-based mapping algorithm to create an initial map of the library environment. The robot is able to recognise the RFID of the book and guide the reader to the shelf. It uses an online path planner to avoid any static or dynamic obstacles such as other readers moving inside the library.
