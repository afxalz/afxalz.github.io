I am Research Fellow at the [Multi-Robot Systems lab](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/) in Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.
I have been working on multi-robot intelligence and coordination for high speed flights in cluttered environments.
My work in supervised of [Dr. Martin Saska](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/members/martin-saska).

I graduated with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence from the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://oi.fel.cvut.cz/en/) in 2022.
During my masters I have worked on decentralized control of multi-UAV systems under the supervision of [Dr. Martin Saska](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/members/martin-saska).
My masters thesis focused on investigating multi-UAV trajectory planning with limited to no information sharing among the UAVs.

Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor's in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) in 2019.
As an undergraduate researcher, I worked on simulating a swarm of ground robots at the [MIST lab](http://mistlab.ca/), Polytechnique Montreal.
